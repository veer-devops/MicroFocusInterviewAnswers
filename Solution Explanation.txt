I have created the required app in PHP language and its compatiable with command line. The system on which you may run this app should have php installed and working. 

To run the app 

1) open bash terminal (if you are using Linux)

Command is ditributed into three sections 

2) Program interperator - filename - argument. In this case the command would be path to php bin file 

/usr/bin/php index.php population.csv
/usr/bin/php index.php population.json

After running this above command the desired output would be displayed on the terminal i.e

If you intend to keep csv or json files to some other path then you need to give the exact path of the file. e.g

/usr/bin/php index.php /path/to/population.csv
/usr/bin/php index.php /path/to/population.json
